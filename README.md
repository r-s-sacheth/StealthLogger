# StealthLogger

StealthLogger is a Python keylogger that runs in the background, recording keystrokes and encrypting them using the Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm. It provides a basic level of stealth by encrypting the keystrokes, making them harder to decipher.


## Features
  - Records keystrokes in the background
  - Encrypts keystrokes using the Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm
  - Provides basic logging functionality
  - Supports termination by pressing the "esc" key twice in a row
